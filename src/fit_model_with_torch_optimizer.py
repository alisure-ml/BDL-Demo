# ## Fitting models in BoTorch with a torch.optim.Optimizer
# 
# BoTorch provides a convenient `botorch.fit.fit_gpytorch_model` function with sensible defaults that work on most basic models, including those that botorch ships with. Internally, this function uses L-BFGS-B to fit the parameters. However, in more advanced use cases you may need or want to implement your own model fitting logic.
# 
# This tutorial allows you to customize model fitting to your needs using the familiar PyTorch-style model fitting loop.
# 
# This tutorial is adapted from GPyTorch's [Simple GP Regression Tutorial](https://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch/blob/master/examples/01_Simple_GP_Regression/Simple_GP_Regression.ipynb) and has very few changes because the out-of-the box models that BoTorch provides are GPyTorch models; in fact, they are proper subclasses that add the `botorch.models.Model` API functions.

# In[1]:


import math
import torch

# use a GPU if available
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
dtype = torch.float


# ### Set up function to model
# In this tutorial we will model a simple sinusoidal function with i.i.d. Gaussian noise:
# 
# $$y = \sin(2\pi x) + \epsilon, ~\epsilon \sim \mathcal N(0, 0.15)$$

# #### Initialize training data

# In[3]:


# use regular spaced points on the interval [0, 1]
train_X = torch.linspace(0, 1, 15, dtype=dtype, device=device)
# training data needs to be explicitly multi-dimensional
train_X = train_X.unsqueeze(1)

# sample observed values and add some synthetic noise
train_Y = torch.sin(train_X * (2 * math.pi)) + 0.15 * torch.randn_like(train_X)


# #### Initialize the model
# We will model the function using a `SingleTaskGP`, which by default uses a `GaussianLikelihood` and infers the unknown noise level.
# 
# The default optimizer for the `SingleTaskGP` is L-BFGS-B, which takes as input explicit bounds on the noise parameter. However, the `torch` optimizers don't support parameter bounds as input. To use the `torch` optimizers, then, we'll need to manually register a constraint on the noise level. When registering a constraint, the `softplus` transform is applied by default, enabling us to enforce a lower bound on the noise.
# 
# **Note**: Without manual registration, the model itself does not apply any constraints, due to the interaction between constraints and transforms. Although the `SingleTaskGP` constructor does in fact define a constraint, the constructor sets `transform=None`, which means that the constraint is not enforced. See the [GPyTorch constraints module](https://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch/blob/master/gpytorch/constraints/constraints.py) for additional information.

# In[4]:


from botorch.models import SingleTaskGP
from gpytorch.constraints import GreaterThan


model = SingleTaskGP(train_X=train_X, train_Y=train_Y)
model.likelihood.noise_covar.register_constraint("raw_noise", GreaterThan(1e-5))


# #### Define marginal log likelihood 
# We will jointly optimize the kernel hyperparameters and the likelihood's noise parameter, by minimizing the negative `gpytorch.mlls.ExactMarginalLogLikelihood` (our loss function).

# In[5]:


from gpytorch.mlls import ExactMarginalLogLikelihood

mll = ExactMarginalLogLikelihood(likelihood=model.likelihood, model=model)
# set mll and all submodules to the specified dtype and device
mll = mll.to(train_X)


# #### Define optimizer and specify parameters to optimize
# We will use stochastic gradient descent (`torch.optim.SGD`) to optimize the kernel hyperparameters and the noise level. In this example, we will use a simple fixed learning rate of 0.1, but in practice the learning rate may need to be adjusted.
# 
# Notes:
# - As the `GaussianLikelihood` module is a of child (submodule) of the `SingleTaskGP` moduel, `model.parameters()` will also include the noise level of the `GaussianLikelihood`. 
# - A subset of the parameters could be passed to the optimizer to tune those parameters, while leaving the other parameters fixed.

# In[6]:


from torch.optim import SGD

optimizer = SGD([{'params': model.parameters()}], lr=0.1)


# #### Fit model hyperparameters and noise level
# Now we are ready to write our optimization loop. We will perform 150 epochs of stochastic gradient descent using our entire training set.

# In[7]:


NUM_EPOCHS = 150

model.train()

for epoch in range(NUM_EPOCHS):
    # clear gradients
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    # forward pass through the model to obtain the output MultivariateNormal
    output = model(train_X)
    # Compute negative marginal log likelihood
    loss = - mll(output, model.train_targets)
    # back prop gradients
    loss.backward()
    # print every 10 iterations
    if (epoch + 1) % 10 == 0:
        print(
            f"Epoch {epoch+1:>3}/{NUM_EPOCHS} - Loss: {loss.item():>4.3f} "
            f"lengthscale: {model.covar_module.base_kernel.lengthscale.item():>4.3f} " 
            f"noise: {model.likelihood.noise.item():>4.3f}" 
         )
    optimizer.step()


# #### Compute posterior over test points and plot fit
# We plot the posterior mean and the 2 standard deviations from the mean.

# In[8]:


# set model (and likelihood)
model.eval();


# In[9]:


from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Initialize plot
f, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(6, 4))
# test model on 101 regular spaced points on the interval [0, 1]
test_X = torch.linspace(0, 1, 101, dtype=dtype, device=device)
# no need for gradients
with torch.no_grad():
    # compute posterior
    posterior = model.posterior(test_X)
    # Get upper and lower confidence bounds (2 standard deviations from the mean)
    lower, upper = posterior.mvn.confidence_region()
    # Plot training points as black stars
    ax.plot(train_X.cpu().numpy(), train_Y.cpu().numpy(), 'k*')
    # Plot posterior means as blue line
    ax.plot(test_X.cpu().numpy(), posterior.mean.cpu().numpy(), 'b')
    # Shade between the lower and upper confidence bounds
    ax.fill_between(test_X.cpu().numpy(), lower.cpu().numpy(), upper.cpu().numpy(), alpha=0.5)
ax.legend(['Observed Data', 'Mean', 'Confidence'])
plt.tight_layout()


# ### Interfacing with Ax
# 
# It is simple to package up a custom optimizer loop like the one above and use it within Ax. As described in the [Using BoTorch with Ax tutorial](./custom_botorch_model_in_ax), this requires defining a custom `model_constructor` callable that can then be passed to the `get_botorch` factory function.
